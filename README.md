# Deep Dive Into Temperature Of India :


This project explores India's temperature patterns using deep learning techniques, focusing on time-series forecasting and climate trend analysis. By leveraging historical weather data, it aims to predict future temperature variations and detect anomalies that could indicate climate shifts.


# Key Features :

âœ… Data Collection & Preprocessing â€“ Uses historical temperature datasets, cleans data, and handles missing values.
âœ… Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) â€“ Visualizes temperature trends, seasonality, and anomalies.
âœ… Deep Learning Models â€“ Implements LSTMs, CNNs, and hybrid models for time-series forecasting.
âœ… Model Training & Evaluation â€“ Fine-tunes hyperparameters and evaluates models using metrics like RMSE and MAE.
âœ… Temperature Prediction â€“ Forecasts future temperatures based on past trends.
âœ… Anomaly Detection â€“ Identifies unusual temperature variations that may indicate climate change effects.
